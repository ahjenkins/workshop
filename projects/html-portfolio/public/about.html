<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I grew up in Upstate New York participating in a wide variety of activities including sports, music, Girl Scouts, 
  Rotary Club, STEM programs, and more. Technology has always been something that I didn't want to stop learning 
  about or using. Whether it was an electronic device, video or computer game, or website on the Internet, I wanted
  to get my hands on it. I was fascinated by how fast it was, how it worked, and how I could master or become an
  expert in it.</p>

<p>After graduating Summa Cum Laude with a degree in Information Management & Technology, concentration in Web Design
  Management, and minor in Finance from Syracuse University, I sought to develop my technical skills. I currently work
  as a software engineer and develop generative AI applications. This is exactly the type of cutting-edge technology
  I have continually desired to discover and learn about as I've grown up in the digital age. My favorite part about it
  is being able to combine technology with my wide variety of interests I grew up participating in (e.g. sports, music, 
  volunteering).</p>

<p>Everything I build and create, I want to share with and serve others.</p>
